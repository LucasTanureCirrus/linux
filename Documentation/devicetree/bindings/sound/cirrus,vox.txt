Cirrus Logic CLSIC Voice Biometrics Codec

The CLSIC MFD device driver starts a clsic-vox codec driver to manage the Vox
service present within CS48LX50 devices. The Vox service combines a low power
voice trigger engine with biometric recognition for seamless authenticated wake
on command usecases.

The clsic-vox codec exposes a DAI offering a faster-than-realtime audio stream
for a speech recognition system to interpret and a number of ALSA controls that
represent configurable features of the Vox service.

Required properties:
- compatible : "cirrus,clsic-vox"
- #sound-dai-cells : "<1>"

Example:
cs48lx50: cs48lx50@0 {
	compatible = "cirrus,clsic";
	cs48lx50_vox: cs48lx50_vox@0 {
		compatible = "cirrus,clsic-vox";
		#sound-dai-cells = <1>;
	};
};
